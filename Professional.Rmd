Here's some text. I like the internet. I use [google](https://www.google.ca/) all the time to do data science.

We can try to use html code to format the image instead of using rmd language.

<img src="images/Grisou.jpg" style="width:25%">

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

sample = rnorm(1000)
mean(sample)
```

Here's a direct link to the about page: [about](about.html).

I also made a bonus [extra page](extra_page.html).
